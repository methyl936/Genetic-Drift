Genetic drift is the change in the frequency of a gene variant in a population over multiple generations. An individualâ€™s alleles are a sample of those in present their parents and chance has a role in determining whether that individual will survive and reproduce. Genetic
drift may cause gene variants to disappear completely from a population and thereby reduce genetic variation. The script simulates the two genetic drift models.
